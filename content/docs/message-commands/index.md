Message commands are accessed by tapping the three "More" dots on desktop or long-pressing a message on Discord mobile. In both cases you can go to "Apps" and the commands should have the Tibby avatar in front of them.

#### Translate to English
Self-explanatory, takes the message the command is used on and translates the contents to English. The command doesn't work if the message has an embed or otherwise does not have any text content.
Messages with images still work as long as the image is not the only content.
