Tibby supports some slash commands that don't require much explanation. Those are described here :)

<!--more-->

{{< callout type="info" >}}
When reading using these commands, `[]` indicates optional parameters and `<>` indicates required ones
{{< /callout >}}

#### /8ball [message]
`/8ball` provides you with a yes or no answer, if you give it a message (ideally a question) it will be included in the response.

#### /batlibs \<message\>
`/batlibs` takes a message with tokens and replaces those tokens with words from the corresponding category.  

The tokens currently supported are as follows:
 - $NOUN
 - $VERB
 - $ANIMAL
 - $FRUIT
