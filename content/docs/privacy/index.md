With Tibby I don't aim to profit from your information, any data we store is either offered voluntarily for enhanced interactions with the bot or stored very temporarily.

<!--more-->

Because of some limitations in the Discord API it may be necessary to temporarily store message data when it is being interacted with. This data is only stored for the duration of the interaction unless stated otherwise on this page.

### Processing by external entities
Some functionality of Tibby sends contents of your messages to third party services, mainly Google for the use of their Translations API and Microsoft for usage of their Computer Vision capabilities.

Read this for information on [Google's data processing policies for the Cloud Translation API.](https://cloud.google.com/translate/data-usage)

Read this for information on [Microsoft's data processing policies in regard to their Computer Vision (more specifically Optical Character Recognition) service,](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/ocr-data-privacy-security)

In my opinion both companies have fair policies on data being submitted. If at any point these policies change or services that have less desirable policies get implemented you'll get the option to opt-out (or opt-in depending on the feature).  

I believe translations and computer vision can provide enhanced accessiblity to online communities, especially those with members in many different countries. This accessibility outweighs any existing concerns in regards to data privacy.
